# Netflix_Prize_Matrix_Completion

Data collection processes are often tampered with by sensor malfunctioning, lost  connections, or simply by unseen or unknown data, resulting in highly-sparse data  matrices. Completing unknown entries is a problem known as matrix completion. One  approach to tackle this task is learning the latent embeddings of the known data and  with this, being able to reconstruct the unknown entries. In this project, we use Matrix  Factorization and Variational AutoEncoder as methods to solve this problem, and the  dataset we use is the Netflix Prize Dataset. In 2009, Netflix held a competition for  predicting users’ ratings for movies with a prize of 1,000,000$ for whoever could best  Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting this rate. In this project, with the help of said  algorithms, we face the problem prediction of users’ ratings for movies with acceptable  precision.
